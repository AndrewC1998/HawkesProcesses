## Some notes on R Packages

An R project has been created. Please read up on how to add new functions to the project and the click build in the top right hand side. This will create a useable package in your R environment. If you need to build functions off other packages, the other package needs added to the namespace file.

## Commits

When committing please name your commits as Date - Title. This is to easily create a well documented history for the write up.
