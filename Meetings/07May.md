# First Meeting

## Tasks for us:

- Read more around each specific topic (in my case identifiability. good starting point: https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/bitstream/10044/1/67167/7/AOAS1240.pdf)

- Simulate a generic multivariate Hawkes process with an asymmetric parameter matrix. Using the method outlined in: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04654.pdf

-  Start introduction/notation section and then begin lit review on your methods in applications outside of Hawkes Processes (stochastic processes in general or possibly time series) and anything specifically relating to hawkes processes.

## Tasks for Ed

- Arrange individual meetings with each of us.
